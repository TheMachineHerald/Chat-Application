# Chat-Application
A Chat Application built with ReactJS and written in TypeScript. I used Redux and React-Redux for handling state. I used scss and the styles module system for greater decoupling and modularity. 

This is not a "Create-React-APP" application-- I installed webpack, the necessary transpilers and loaders, and did the build configuration myself as I wanted to have full control of my application without all the unneeded boilerplate. The webpack configuration is very simple and transpiles and then bundles the files into a "public" directory.

I felt having a full understanding of what was being used was important to me so that I could configure the build scripts without referring to some "how to(s)..." on the React site or stackoverflow and not understand why or how it worked-- I wanted to be able to predict and understand how the build process would execute.
