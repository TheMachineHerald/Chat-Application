# Chat-Application
A Chat Application built with ReactJS. Other main technologies include Redux and some light abstractions around the Browser's WebSocket API. This is not a "Create-React-APP" application-- I did the build configuration myself as I wanted to have full control of my application without all the unneeded boilerplate. The webpack configuration is very simple and transpiles and then bundles the files into a "public" directory. 

The codebase is very modular, but it's still incomplete and I plan on refactoring certain parts to add even greater decoupling + modularity for the sake of simplicity and scalability.

WARNING!!!

Breaking changes are made constantly-- pull at your own risk...
